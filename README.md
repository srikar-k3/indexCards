# indexCards

This prototype is a basic demonstration of an interactive index card application. Key features include:

- Create Index Cards: Users can create new index cards with a simple click of a button.
- Edit Content: Each index card supports text input, allowing users to type and edit their notes.
- Drag and Drop: Users can drag and reposition index cards anywhere within the workspace.

### Future Enhancements

As an iPad app, this prototype could be expanded with additional features:

- Drawing Capability: Beyond text, index cards could support drawing and sketching.
- Stacking and Snapping: Index cards could be organized into stacks, similar to how "Procreate" allows users to stack canvases for better organization and management.
